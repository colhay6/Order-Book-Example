# Order Book Example

## Description
This is a basic python implementation of an order book. The code has not been cleaned up, and it contains quite a few print statements used during development.

## Use
Running the OrderBook.py file will initiliaze an order book object, and insert a random set of orders. The order book prints its current state to the console, and correctly updates as buy and sell orders are inserted.
